		<p>Attendees should begin arriving at 8pm through the Ruxton Technology Centre entrance. You may have to queue to sign-in at the front desk, so if you have transported your equipment yourself we would advise you keep it in your car so that you do not have to carry it during sign-in. There is a plentiful amount of parking available outside Ruxton, so you should not have any issues parking.</p>

		<p>Once you have signed in, you will then be permitted to enter the player area, collect your equipment (if we provided you with equipment transport) and set up at your designated seat. <strong>Seats marked as reserved have been pre-booked, so if you did not pre-book your seat please do not take one of these seats.</strong></p>

		<p>There will be a welcome talk in the Ruxton Lecture Theatre at <strong>21.00</strong>, all attendees will be required to attend this talk as it includes important safety information that we are required to provide to you.</p>
